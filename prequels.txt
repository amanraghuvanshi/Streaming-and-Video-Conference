Video Conferencing and Live Streaming

There will be three components:

1) Routes: Fiber	
	We will have room here, that will have the operation that are being performed

2) WebSockets: Websocket/Fiber
	This helps us in chatting with the other person that are there in the room,
	
3) Stream: WebRTC
	This will be supporting our streaming
<------------------------------------------------->

We will also use the docker

So, around the concept of Video Conferencing is based on the theory of  room. So its similar to how the people sit in a room and they discuss their stuffs. So here in this project we are creating the rooms, in which people having the link can join and they can talk and broadcast their messages.
